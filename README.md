Chosen Dataset: Social Media Users
Difficulties Encountered
Import Process:
I encountered some difficulties during the dataset import process into MySQL Workbench due to the format of the data and encoding issues. However, these were resolved by adjusting the import settings and ensuring compatibility with MySQL's requirements.

Interesting Observation
Insight:
One interesting observation from the Social Media Users dataset was the significant difference in user engagement patterns between different social media platforms. For example, platform A had consistently higher daily active users compared to platform B, indicating varying levels of user retention and interaction.
